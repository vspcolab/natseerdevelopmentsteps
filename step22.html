    <h2>🔹 Step-by-Step Procedure for Supplier Contract Negotiation & Pricing</h2>

    <h3>1️⃣ Prepare a Negotiation Plan with Target Pricing & Terms</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Decide target price per ingredient (based on market rates & profit margins).</li>
      <li>✅ Choose preferred payment terms (e.g., 50% advance, Net 30 days, partial prepayment).</li>
      <li>✅ Identify backup suppliers to strengthen negotiation leverage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>🎯 Outcome:</strong> ✅ Defined pricing targets & negotiation strategy.</p>

    <h3>2️⃣ Contact Suppliers & Initiate Pricing Discussions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Call/email suppliers to request bulk pricing & MOQ details.</li>
      <li>✅ Compare pricing from multiple suppliers to find the best deal.</li>
      <li>✅ Highlight potential long-term partnerships to secure better rates.</li>
      <li>✅ If needed, visit supplier facilities to inspect production capabilities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>🎯 Outcome:</strong> ✅ Multiple pricing quotes collected & compared.</p>

    <h3>3️⃣ Negotiate Bulk Discounts, Payment Terms & Delivery Conditions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Leverage Bulk Orders: "If we commit to monthly orders, can we get 15-20% off?"</li>
      <li>✅ Flexible Payment Terms: "We prefer Net 30 payment. Can you accommodate that?"</li>
      <li>✅ MOQ Reduction: "For the first order, can we start with 50% MOQ?"</li>
      <li>✅ Shipping & Logistics: "Can you offer free shipping for orders above ₹2,00,000?"</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>🎯 Outcome:</strong> ✅ Best pricing, favorable payment terms & reliable delivery conditions negotiated.</p>

    <h3>4️⃣ Finalize Supplier Contracts & Sign Agreement</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Final agreed price per kg/unit for each raw material.</li>
      <li>✅ Payment schedule & mode (Bank transfer, credit terms).</li>
      <li>✅ Quality standards & rejection policy (Minimum accepted purity level).</li>
      <li>✅ Delivery schedule & penalties for delays.</li>
      <li>✅ Replacement & refund policy for defective batches.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>🎯 Outcome:</strong> ✅ Legally binding supplier agreements signed.</p>

    <h3>5️⃣ Place First Bulk Order & Monitor Supplier Performance</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Place initial bulk order (small batch to test reliability).</li>
      <li>✅ Track delivery timelines & order fulfillment rate.</li>
      <li>✅ Test sample batch quality before full-scale production.</li>
      <li>✅ Set up ongoing supplier performance tracking.</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>🔹 Troubleshooting & Common Issues</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>📍 Supplier Unwilling to Offer Discounts:</strong> Offer long-term contracts for better rates.</li>
    <li><strong>📝 High MOQ (Minimum Order Quantity) Requirement:</strong> Negotiate lower MOQ for trial order before committing to larger batches.</li>
    <li><strong>🚀 Payment Terms Not Favorable:</strong> Use staggered payments (e.g., 30% advance, 70% on delivery) to reduce cash flow risk.</li>
    <li><strong>💰 Raw Material Costs Fluctuating:</strong> Lock in fixed pricing for 6-12 months to avoid market fluctuations.</li>
    <li><strong>🏗️ Supplier Delays in Delivery:</strong> Add penalties for late shipments in contracts.</li>
  </ul>
